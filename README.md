A realy rather ropey extension for python to control and capture frames from the Intel realsense camera.

Writtien and compiled in Visual Studio 2015

Based on this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIkIdjN6Oyw but returning a numpy array.

Add ability to set camera capture params and which streams to enable

Just generally  make it good!!
