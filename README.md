# PyRealSense
Python control and capture things

A realy rather ropey extension for python to control and capture frames from the Intel realsense camera.

Based on this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIkIdjN6Oyw but returning a numpy array.

TODO:

Add error handeling (absolutle none in there at the moment!!)
Add ability to set camera capture params
Make getframe() return data from all cameras

Just generally  make it good!!
